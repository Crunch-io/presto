Dashboards
----------

A dashboard is a deck that has been configured to be displayed in presentation
mode by default. They can be accessed directly by a client URL where only
the Deck ID is made available.

This endpoint works as a helper to obtain a direct reference to the deck without
necessarily knowing under which Dataset is located.
