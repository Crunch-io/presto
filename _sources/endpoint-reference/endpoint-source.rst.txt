Sources
-------

A *source* is a file that can be ingested by Crunch, either to define a dataset or to
add data to it (or both). When used in an import operation, the file becomes the
*source* for part or all of a dataset. *Sources* is not a general-purpose file-store; it
is intended only for files used for Crunch imports.

An uploaded file is *registered* as a source for a particular dataset when it is used in
an import operation. Once a source has been "registered" as part of an import, it cannot
be deleted unless the target dataset has been deleted.

Each source belongs to a specific user. A sources catalog response will contain only
those sources belonging to the requesting user and a newly added source will be assigned
to the requesting user. Sources are unordered.

Access to sources is limited to users with `create_datasets` permissions.
