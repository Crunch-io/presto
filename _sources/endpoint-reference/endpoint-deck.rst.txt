Decks
-----

A *Deck* allows an ordered collection of analyses to be stored for
future use or for export. Each deck belongs to a dataset and its analyses are drawn from
that single dataset. A deck is personal to the user that created it unless the deck has
been set "public". Each deck contains a sequence of slides, and each slide contains
an analysis. Additional analyses can be associated with a slide, but only the first one
appears in the UI or on export.

Slides
------

Each deck contains a catalog of slides in which analyses are saved.

Each slide in the Slide Catalog contains a reference to its first analysis.

Order
~~~~~

The owner of the deck can specify the order of its slides. As with deck
order, the slide order must be a flat list of slide URLs.

Analysis
--------

Each slide contains one or more analyses. An analysis -- a table or
graph with some specific combination of variables defining measures,
rows, columns, and tabs; and settings such as percentage direction and
decimal places -- can be saved to a *deck*, which can then be exported,
or the analysis can be reloaded in whole in the application or even
exported as a standalone embeddable result. Note that while a slide can
have multiple analyses, only the first analysis for each slide is used
when exporting to Excel or PowerPoint.
