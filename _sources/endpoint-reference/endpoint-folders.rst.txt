Variable Folders
----------------

In order to organize a large number of variables in a dataset, Crunch
provides a hierarchical structure to group variables called "Folders".

Basic concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables are in one and only one folder at all times.

There are a number of system folders that exist with every dataset created.
These system folders cannot be renamed, moved, or deleted.

* **Root folder**: The root folder is the top level folder where all
  other subfolders will be created by dataset editors. All the variables
  and subfolders here will be publicly accessible for all users with
  access to the dataset.
* **Hidden folder**: This folder is a parallel top level folder separate
  from the root folder, which allows dataset editors to hide variables
  out of the public Root folder. "Hiddenness" is about display concerns,
  not authorization rules. API clients choose not to display hidden
  variables to users with view-only access, though they may use hidden
  variables in queries and may use filters and other assets derived from
  hidden variables.
* **Secure folder**: Like the hidden folder, the secure folder is a
  special top-level folder. Secure variables are not shown in any form
  to users with view-only access to a dataset, and it is not possible
  for viewers to make queries with secure variables or access filters or
  other assets that reference secure variables.
