Multitables
-----------

If a "table" is a rows-variable crosstabbed with a columns-variable, a *multitable* is
a rows-variable crosstabbed with *multiple* columns-variables. The crosstab for each
columns-variable is "tiled" side-by-side with the other columns-variable crosstabs such
that a single contiguous visual table results.

This analysis format allows the relationship between multiple variables and the
rows-variable to be conveniently compared, side-by-side.

A *tabbook* is an (Excel) export format where one or more rows-variables are selected to
be cross-tabulated against the set of columns-variables defined in a multitable. By
default, each resulting table is displayed in a separate Excel "tab" (worksheet),
producing a workbook of crosstabs, hence the name *tabbook*.
