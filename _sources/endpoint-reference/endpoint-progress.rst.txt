Progress
--------

Progress resources provide information about the current state of a
long-running server process in Crunch. Some requests at certain
endpoints may return 202 status containing a progress URL in the body,
at which one can monitor the progress of the request that was accepted
and not yet completed.

See `API Reference - Task progress <https://crunch.io/api/reference/#get-/progress/-task_id-/>`_.
