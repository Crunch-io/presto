Accounts
--------

Accounts provide an organization-level scope for Crunch.io customers.
All Users belong to one and only one Account. Account managers can
administer their various users and entities and have visibility on them.

Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~

A user is an "account manager" if their ``account_permissions`` have
``admin_account`` set to ``True``.

Account entity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The account entity is available on the API root following the Shoji
``views.account`` path, which will point to the authenticated user's
account.

If the account has a name, it will be available here, as well as the
path to the account's users.

Branding configuration for the account is also exposed here, through
the ``palette`` and ``logo`` attributes.

If the authenticated user is an account manager, the response will
include paths to these additional catalogs:

- Account projects
- Account teams
- Account datasets
